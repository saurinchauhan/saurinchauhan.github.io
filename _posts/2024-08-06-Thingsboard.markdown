# ThingsBoard Open Source IoT Platform

While searching for open source solutions IoT solutions, I came across Thingsboard. It provides comprenhesive solution for all IoT related concerns.

During the exploration I focused on mainly these 4 things.

1. Device Onboarding
2. Telemetry Messages
3. Send commands to devices
4. OTA Updates

Apart from this it has a lot to offer like 
 - Real time Dashboards
 - Setting up alerts and notifications
 - Rule Chain setup 
 - Device Profiles
 - Edge Device Management 

Thingsboard also provides tenant based UI access which allows you to manage multiple different clients on same platform setup.
