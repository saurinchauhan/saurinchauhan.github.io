# ThingsBoard Open Source IoT Platform

While searching for open source solutions IoT solutions, I came across Thingsboard. It provides comprenhesive solution for all IoT related concerns.

During the exploration I focused on mainly these 4 things.

1. Device Onboarding
2. Telemetry Messages
3. Send commands to devices
4. OTA Updates

Thingsboard also provides tenant based UI access which allows you to manage multiple different clients on same platform setup.
