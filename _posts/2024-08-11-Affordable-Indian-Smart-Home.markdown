# TL;DR

In India Smart Home tech. is still growing, in every house hold there are multiple appliances which you can control or monitor digitally. But these devices still require human inputs to operate. The devices or appliances still do not have automation(i.e: After sunset the lights should start automatically in the house).


But it does not mean that there are no smart devices available in the Indian market. There are a lot of companies manufacturing these devices.

The issue with such devices is that each device brand comes with their own Mobile app and their own echo system so for a customer it is an additional headache to manage these apps if they buy devices from different brands.

Also the setup process is not that easy.

So mostly people will buy these devices mainly when they buy a new home and then continue with those devices.

I would like to categorize these devices as below in Indian house hold context.

1. __Absolute Essentials__

Absolute essentials devices are the ones that people use every day and the ones that are found in every house hold regardless of regular usage.

    - Lights
    - AC
    - Celling Fans
    - Washing Machines
    - TV
    - Smart plugs

2. __Would like to have__

This category devices are the ones that people do not buy out of necessity but would like to have if they find it useful or if they like the product

    - Wifi cameras for Home security
    - Doorbell camera
    - Dashcams
    - Curtains
    - Smart pots for plants
    - Interactive home [ voice assistant like Google home , alexa ]
    - Climate control, Thermostat

3. __Expensive setup__

This category's device does not fall into affordable, the setup will be used by people who want additional features into their home.

    - Sensors like Smoke sensors, door sensors for protection 
    - Home surveillance, with motion sensor in dedicated zones, alerts and notifications, day and night surveillance etc.

In coming years with Category 1 and 2 if the devices are made with capacity of inter communication and a smart home central application then it has the potential of changing a regular Indian house hold to a Smart home while providing affordable products.
